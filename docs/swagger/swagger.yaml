      deletionTimestamp:
        description: |-
          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.
          Read-only.

      finalizers:
        description: |-
          Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry
          is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry
          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique

          If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
          than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
          The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
          and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
          unique on the server.

          If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.

          understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a
          controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like
          "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the

          regular update using the same manager name.
